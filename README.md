# SingleViewCoreDataTemplate

4/15/2017 - This core data stack is now outdated with the changes to Swift 3

This is an Xcode template for Single View app using a "Better Core Data Stack"

In order to use this you must put it in usr/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Application/YourFolderName_ThatYouCreate/

This template was built for Xcode 7 and Swift 2. It may or may not work in any other versions, I have not tested in anything else but this.
